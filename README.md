### How do I approach designing software?

Software design is a complicated topic since I find it hard to fully define.  The requirements for this project were thoroughly outlined by the project rubrics, and I simply met those requirements in a personalized way.  It doesn't feel like I designed anything, and I didn't need to outline a plan to follow throughout this project.  I have done so in other projects, but this one didn't have all that much design involved at all.  I suppose I designed the scene and the nature of the program by creating a vision of the end result and taking decided steps towards that vision all the while.  

### How do I approach developing programs?

When I want to develop software, I begin with I work sequentially from the ground up.  If I do know things about the language in question, then I usually build a very basic framework or take an existing project and strip it down to the bones before testing and making sure I have a solid foundation.  After that, I begin defining the functionality that I want and constructing it incrementally.  At each stage, after each change that I'm not certain of, I run the program again.  This helps me spot errors as soon as they arise, allowing me to easily discern the root issue and correct them before they cause cascading errors.  

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science grants me insight into the nature of existing computers programs and the construction of new computer programs.  My goals involve a number of personal projects and professional aspirations, and computer science is already helping me accomplish both.  I have developed python scripts to help me type complex repetitive string loop, I have created a website where I can post my ideas regarding TTRPGs, and I am nearly completion of my Bachelor's Degree which I will use along with my experience to pursue a career in Web Development, Software Engineering, or Data Science.  

Studying Computer Science doesn't just help me reach my goals; it is one of my goals.
